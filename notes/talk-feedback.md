* [ ] concurrent page table walks --> model may need to allow non-atomic walks
* [ ] pre-existing virtual address space --> kernel pages backing the page table, carve address space fragment?
* [ ] break before make
* [ ] memory model arbitrary except for atomic operations; may be useful for concurrent walks
* [ ] TLB-shootdown-- verify the protocol, not the code
* [ ] kernel load/stores



one outstanding PT in progress
