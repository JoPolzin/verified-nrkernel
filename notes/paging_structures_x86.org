Main takeaway: Directories only differ in whether certain bits are ignored or
must-be-zero. For page mappings, the only difference is PAT/PS location for 4K
pages and the address mask.

The table contains the bit-locations of each field for each of PML4, PDPT, PD,
PT when mapping either a page or a directory.
Fields that are specified as ignored or must-be-zero are listed as such.
The table should be complete (i.e. for each column the listed bit locations
should cover 63:0).

M refers to MAXPHYADDR.
Note: PML4/PML5 can't map pages and PT can't map directories; I.e. those are omitted.
We assume "ordinary" paging, no HLAT. We assume "not (CR4.PKE or CR4.PKS = 1)" (meaning bits 62:59 in all entries are ignored/mbz).
